					<h3><font color="black">What we do</font></h3>
						<p> <font color="black"> Pantheon is a crowdsourced debt funding platform targeting early stage ventures. Founded by three UVA CS students, the company takes advantage of growing interest in crowdfunding while lowering investor risk. Traditional angel investing is an all or nothing payout and is a difficult position to exit. Gradual repayment over the term of a bond ensures at least some returns. This lowers the search cost of capital, allows founders to retain equity, and facilitates startups in VC dead zones. We’re launching while regulators start to crack down on crowdsourced equity funding and competitors like Kickstarter focus on “creativity” which leaves an obvious unfilled niche in the market. </font>
 						</p>
 						<h3><font color="black">Why our product works</font></h3>
 						<p><font color="black">The internet has revolutionized almost every aspect of business and for financing that’s taken the form of crowdfunding. By many estimates, crowdfunding has already surpassed venture capital (VC). In fact the World Bank estimates that by 2025 crowdfunding will be a source of $93 billion. The current crowdfunding market can be described in three segments: capital for tangible gifts (ie Kickstarter), capital for a cause (ie GoFundMe), and capital for equity (ie SeedInvest). This leaves capital for debt as a clearly unfilled niche in the crowdfunding market, which is where our servies step in.</p>
